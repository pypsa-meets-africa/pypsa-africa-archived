,Unit,Values,Description
voltages,kV,"Any subset of {220., 300., 380.}",Voltage levels to consider when
co2limit,:math:`t_{CO_2-eq}/a`,float,Cap on total annual system carbon dioxide emissions
co2base,:math:`t_{CO_2-eq}/a`,float,Reference value of total annual system carbon dioxide emissions if relative emission reduction target is specified in ``{opts}`` wildcard.
agg_p_nom_limits,file,path,Reference to ``.csv`` file specifying per carrier generator nominal capacity constraints for individual countries if ``'CCL'`` is in ``{opts}`` wildcard. Defaults to ``data/agg_p_nom_minmax.csv``.
hvdc_as_lines,,true or false,"A flag specifying if the HVDC should be modeled as Lines or as Links components"
operational_reserve,,,
-- activate,,true or false,
-- epsilon_load,,"float, share of total load, between 0-1",
-- epsilon_vres,,"float, share of total renewable supply, between 0-1",
-- contingency,MW,"float, fixed contigency over optimization timeframe i.e. 5000 MW",
extendable_carriers,,,
-- Generator,--,"Any subset  of {'OCGT','CCGT'}",Places extendable conventional power plants (OCGT and/or CCGT) where gas power plants are located today without capacity limits.
-- StorageUnit,--,"Any subset of {'battery','H2'}",Adds extendable storage units (battery and/or hydrogen) at every node/bus after clustering without capacity limits and with zero initial capacity.
-- Store,--,"Any subset of {'battery','H2'}",Adds extendable storage units (battery and/or hydrogen) at every node/bus after clustering without capacity limits and with zero initial capacity.
-- Link,--,Any subset of {'H2 pipeline'},Adds extendable links (H2 pipelines only) at every connection where there are lines or HVDC links without capacity limits and with zero initial capacity. Hydrogen pipelines require hydrogen storage to be modelled as ``Store``.
max_hours,,,
-- battery,h,float,Maximum state of charge capacity of the battery in terms of hours at full output capacity ``p_nom``. Cf. `PyPSA documentation <https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html#storage-unit>`_.
-- H2,h,float,Maximum state of charge capacity of the hydrogen storage in terms of hours at full output capacity ``p_nom``. Cf. `PyPSA documentation <https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html#storage-unit>`_.
powerplants_filter,--,"use `pandas.query <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.query.html>`_ strings here, e.g. Country not in ['Germany']",Filter query for the default powerplant database.
custom_powerplants,--,"use `pandas.query <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.query.html>`_ strings here, e.g. Country in ['Germany']",Filter query for the custom powerplant database.
conventional_carriers,--,"Any subset of {nuclear, oil, OCGT, CCGT, coal, lignite, geothermal, biomass}",List of conventional power plants to include in the model from ``resources/powerplants.csv``.
renewable_capacities_from_OPSD,,"[solar, onwind, offwind]",List of carriers (offwind-ac and offwind-dc are included in offwind) whose capacities 'p_nom' are aligned to the `OPSD renewable power plant list <https://data.open-power-system-data.org/renewable_power_plants/>`_
estimate_renewable_capacities_from_capacitiy_stats,,,
"-- Fueltype [ppm], e.g. Wind",,"list of fueltypes strings in PyPSA-Eur, e.g. [onwind, offwind-ac, offwind-dc]",converts ppm Fueltype to PyPSA-EUR Fueltype
estimate_renewable_capacities,,,
-- stats,,'irena' or ``False``,"Defines which database to use, currently only ""irena"" is available. ``False`` enables greenfield expansion, 'irena' uses IRENA stats to add expansion limits"
-- year,,Any year beetween 2000 and 2020,"Reference year, available years for IRENA stats are 2000 to 2020"
-- p_nom_min,,float,"scales the minimum expansion acquired from stats, i.e. 110% of <years>'s capacities => p_nom_min: 1.1"
-- p_nom_max,,float or ``False``,"sets the expansion constraint, False to deactivate this option and use estimated renewable potentials determine by the workflow, float scales the p_nom_min factor accordingly"
-- technology_mapping,,,Maps the technologies defined in ppm.data.Capacity_stats with the carriers in PyPSA-Earth/Africa
-- -- Offshore,,"{'offwind-ac', 'offwind-dc'}",
-- -- Onshore,,{'onwind'},
-- -- PV,,{'solar'},
