Welcome to the PyPSA meets Africa documentation!
================================================

PyPSA meets Africa is a free and open source software project aiming to develop a powerful energy system model for Africa and beyond. The tool is currently under development and will be heavily based on `PyPSA <https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and `PyPSA-Eur <https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. A short presentation about our project and its aims is given on our `website <https://pypsa-meets-africa.github.io/>`_. There you can also sign-up to our Newsletter. 

Watch our latest discussion with African leaders about `Open Energy System Modelling in Africa: State of the Art and Future Opportunities <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0V0T4U9nmQ>`_. Let's work together for a better future.
