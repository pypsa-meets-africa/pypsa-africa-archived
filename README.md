PyPSA meets Africa is a free and open source software project aiming to develop a powerful energy system model for Africa.

The tool which is currently under development and will be heavily based on [PyPSA](https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [PyPSA-Eur](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). A short presentation about our project and its aims is given on our [preliminary website](https://max-parzen.github.io/Project_PyPSA_Africa.html). There you can also sign-up to our Newsletter.

Watch our latest discusson with African leaders about [Open Energy System Modelling in Africa: State of the Art and Future Opportunities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0V0T4U9nmQ). Let's work together for a better future.

The python package requirements are curated in the `envs/environment.yml` file.
The environment can be installed and activated using

    .../pypsa_meets_africa % conda env create -f envs/environment.yml

    .../pypsa_meets_africa % conda activate pypsa-africa

The development will be documented along the way with [automated readthedocs documentation](https://pypsa-meets-africa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
