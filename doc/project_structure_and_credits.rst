Project structure and credits
##########################################

PyPSA meets Africa is an open source initiative.
We implemented a project structure to enhance collaboration and give people responsibilities.
Therefore, the structure is not here to dictate, it is rather a structure that let people organise and think in different angles about the project.

We all have the same goal. We want to create a long-term maintained, supported and steadily improving energy system model that is useful for industry and research. Every person helping towards achieving this goal is listed in the credits.
